    dummy_poem: `Moonlight's Embrace

In silence draped, the night descends,
Its velvet breath the dark defends.
Yet through the hush a shimmer breaks,
As silver dreams the moonlight wakes.

It bathes the trees in ghostly white,
And kisses hills with gentle light.
A whispered hush, a lover’s sigh,
Falls softly from the sky so high.

The ocean glows with rippled grace,
Each wave a mirror, moon’s own face.
The stars, like sparks in candle’s gleam,
Adrift beside a silver dream.

It walks on roofs, through forest wide,
A secret guest the dark can't hide.
And in its arms, the world turns slow,
Wrapped in a cool, celestial glow.

O moonlight, hush of time and tune,
The earth’s own breath beneath the moon—
A lullaby for hearts grown still,
A balm, a light, a timeless thrill.`,
    dummy_story: `Title: Moonlight and the Whispering Lake

On the edge of a sleepy village nestled between the forest and the hills, there was a lake known only to the locals as Whispering Waters. By day, it was an ordinary patch of stillness, surrounded by reeds and silence. But by night—especially under the full moon—it shimmered with a strange, beautiful magic.

Lina, a quiet girl with wild hair and curious eyes, had always been drawn to the lake. Her grandmother used to tell her stories about it—how moonlight touched its surface and awoke the memories of the earth, whispering forgotten secrets into the wind.

One evening, unable to sleep, Lina tiptoed from her home and followed the forest path by the light of the rising moon. She reached the lake just as the moon crowned the sky, painting everything in silver.

The water stirred. Not with wind—but with something else.

A voice. Soft. Melodic.

"Do you remember us?" it asked.

Lina froze. Then, slowly, she stepped closer to the water’s edge.

"I don’t know who you are," she whispered, unsure if she was dreaming.

The lake rippled. Shapes danced on its surface—memories. A woman standing on the same shore long ago, wearing a pendant shaped like a crescent moon. A boy carving runes into a stone. A gathering of people singing to the sky.

"You’ve forgotten the song," the lake sighed. "But your heart has not."

Lina pressed her hand over her chest. Her heart did ache with something unexplainable, a longing she had never understood.

Suddenly, from the reeds, a melody drifted through the air—one she didn’t recognize, yet felt as if she’d known forever. She began to hum, then sing. The lake glowed brighter, and the voices in the wind joined her.

By dawn, the lake had returned to its calm. But Lina felt different. She carried something ancient now—a memory not just of her own life, but of those who had come before.

She returned to the village, and every full moon after that, she went back. Not to seek answers, but to sing. To remember. To let the moonlight stir what the world had buried.

And from that night on, the Whispering Lake always sang back.`,
